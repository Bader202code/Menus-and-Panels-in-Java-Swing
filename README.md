Logic Explanation of the Code: 

This Java Swing application is structured using modular design, where each panel serves a specific purpose and is managed by the main application (SwingApp). The application uses CardLayout for seamless navigation between different panels.

1. SwingApp (Main Application)
Purpose: Initializes the JFrame, sets up the menu system, and manages panel transitions.
Key Components:
Menu Bar: Allows users to navigate between different panels (UserFormPanel, LoginPanel, AboutPanel, SecretPanel).
CardLayout: Enables dynamic switching between panels.
Event Listeners: Handles menu item clicks to switch views or open the SecretPanel in a new window.
2. HomePanel (Welcome Page)
Purpose: Displays a simple welcome message when the application starts.
Key Component: A JLabel with a greeting message.
3. UserFormPanel (User Registration)
Purpose: Allows users to input and save personal information like username, email, and phone number.
Key Components:
Text Fields for user input.
Save Button to store and confirm user data.
GridBagLayout to arrange components neatly.
4. LoginPanel (User Authentication)
Purpose: Simulates a login interface where users enter their credentials.
Key Components:
Text Fields for username and password.
Login Button to simulate authentication.
Text Area to display user details after login.
5. AboutPanel (Information Page)
Purpose: Displays company/team details and a background image.
Key Components:
Text Label with "About Us" information.
Image Label to display a background image below the text.
6. SecretPanel (Standalone Secret Word Entry)
Purpose: Opens in a separate window when selected from the menu, allowing users to enter and display a secret word.
Key Components:
Text Field for secret word input.
Submit Button to capture the secret word.
Result Label to display the entered word.
How the Modules Connect
SwingApp serves as the main control unit, switching between different panels via CardLayout.
The menu bar enables users to navigate between UserFormPanel, LoginPanel, AboutPanel, and HomePanel.
SecretPanel opens separately in a new JFrame instead of being part of CardLayout.
Data entered in UserFormPanel can be retrieved in LoginPanel to simulate user authentication.
This modular and structured approach makes the application scalable, maintainable, and easy to extend. ðŸš€
